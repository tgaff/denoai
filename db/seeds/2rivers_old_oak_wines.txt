Sun-Kissed Slopes, Soulful Sips: Welcome to Old Oak Vineyards
Nestled in the heart of Green Valley, where the sun kisses the slopes and the River Glasmane whispers tales of time, lies Old Oak Vineyards. Our family, a tapestry woven from generations of human and elf, has nurtured the land for centuries, coaxing from its depths grapes imbued with the valley's unique character.

At Old Oak, tradition meets innovation. We blend time-honored techniques with meticulous care, allowing our grapes to reach their full potential under the watchful eyes of our experienced vintners. The result? Wines that capture the essence of Green Valley â€“ elegant, balanced, and bursting with flavor.

A Symphony of Flavors:

Sunstone Chardonnay: A golden delight, this chardonnay offers notes of citrus, honey, and toasted oak, a perfect complement to summer evenings and fresh seafood.
Emerald Riesling: Light and refreshing, our riesling boasts a vibrant bouquet of green apple, lime, and minerality, ideal for lighter fare and lively conversation.
